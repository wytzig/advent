### Welcome to my 2021 advent excersices! 

In this project I try to complete challenges posed by the advent calender 2021 over at https://adventofcode.com/


## Choices

The project was setup with java18 and maven. Aknowledged that these aren't the cleanest or fastes language & setup available for data manipulation like you'll see, it's a main language I have to learn to swim in. I'd like my reference to match my personal work environment and as long as it works, I'd love to explore the language more.
