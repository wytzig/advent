### Welcome to my 2021 advent excersices! 

In this project I try to complete challenges posed by the advent calender 2021 over at https://adventofcode.com/


## Choices

The project was setup with java18 and maven. Aknowledged that these aren't the cleanest or fastes language & setup available
for data manipulation like you'll see, it's a main language I have to learn to swim in. 
I'd like my reference to match my personal work environment and as long as it works, I'd love to explore the language more. 
Refactoring and iterating over the excercises will lead to improvement of overall re-usablility of code
as well as provide a better (project) architecture which can be used in the future as framework for new applications. 

Designed for and with microservice architecture in mind.
