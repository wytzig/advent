### Welcome to my 2021 advent excersices!

In this project I try to complete challenges posed by the advent calender 2021 over at https://adventofcode.com/
I did these on my own, some in 2021 but also continued in other years as I have too little time to spend on these things.

I like doing this because it helps me train my coding skills and logical thinking. 
I'm not looking to experiment much as it's mainly solving puzzles that I am intrested in. The technology is just a means
to this end.
