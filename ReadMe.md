# Introduction
Welcome to my advent of code repository! 
here I try completing code challenges, or puzzles from https://adventofcode.com/

I seperated code base per year and in every folder is therefore also another, more tailored, readMe so please also 
take a look over there. 

To run this project you only need java SDK 18 and enable -ea in your VM options. (for asserts)

## Choices

The project was setup with java18 and maven. Aknowledged that these aren't the cleanest or fastes language & setup available
for data manipulation like you'll see, it's a main language I have to learn to swim in. 
I'd like my reference to match my personal work environment and as long as it works, I'd love to explore the language more. 
Refactoring and iterating over the excercises will lead to improvement of overall re-usablility of code
as well as provide a better (project) architecture which can be used in the future as framework for new applications. 

Designed for and with microservice architecture in mind. 


### TTD & TBD

Project could/should work with TDD (Test Driven Development, preferably red, green and blue testing) and TBD (Trunk based developement). 
  - TDD,
    In advent of code, you will get an example next to the puzzle description with some dummy data to
    show what the input - outputs looks like. Often I just copy and paste this data and try getting the same result as they
    in this example. Only after I succeed in that I move on with the true puzzle input. 

  - TBD, will allow for only a limited number of branches to commit from. Likewise, small commits on master should always be prefered.
    Old branches and features should be left forgotten or preferably just deleted outright. For these advent code puzzles 
    I will be working alone and thus a real need for version management (like git) or complex merges will not occur at all.
